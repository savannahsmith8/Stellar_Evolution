ASTR 400A: Theoretical Astrophysics I (Stellar Structure and Evolution)

This course discussed the theory of stellar structure and evolution, as well as star formation. The course ASTR 400A was designed to apply a physically motivated theoretical basis to stellar structure, use mathematical and computational skills to solve theoretical stellar astrophysical problems, and interpret and communicate fundamental astrophysical concepts. 
This repository displays my homework assignments and my final project from this course taken in Fall 2024 (course taught by Professor Mathieu Renzo)
